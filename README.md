# Code

This is the initial Github repo to document the code for my Bachelors thesis: "Characterising Position Bias in Language Modelâ€™s Outputs".

initial testing: documents the first tests I ran to see how I can get the log-likelihood of the output of the Pythia models.

home validation set testing: I will try to adapt the initial code according to the specifications set initially and run a few starting tests on the validation set on my own computer.

sequence_0_NLL_test: I attempt to run the complete evaluation of one single document (doc-0)
